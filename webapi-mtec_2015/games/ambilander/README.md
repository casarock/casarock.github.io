# Ambi Lander

[My #altctrl jam entry](http://www.altctrlgamejam.com/games/541d471864ff4f2c5a10cc8e).

Could be installed on FirefoxOS/Firefox Mobile. If you are playing with a Desktop computer, check if you've got an ambient light sensor. Macbook usally have it built in. It's located near the isight camera.

Works in Firefox only.
